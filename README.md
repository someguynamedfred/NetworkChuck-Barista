# NetworkChuck-Barista

My code for the NetworkChuck Python course. I added a few things to give it some more flavor. 

This was created for educational purposes and I used a significant amount of code from NetworkChuck. You can check out his course here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRMmlo_Uqcs&ab_channel=NetworkChuck]
